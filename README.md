# Giphy Party

Created by Adel Ngo

This application will allow the user to enter an input and use AJAX to send a Get request to the Giphy API based on the user input. 
It will then display the requested gif on the webpage. If the user clicks on the "Remove Images" button it will remove all images on the webpage.
